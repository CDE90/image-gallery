```html
<figure>
    <img
        src="/images/sunset-beach.jpg"
        alt="Sunset at the beach"
        loading="lazy"

### Step 2: Upload the Video and Thumbnail

1. Go to our GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "videos" folder and upload your MP4 file.
3. Click on the "images" folder and upload your thumbnail image.
4. For each upload, write a short commit message like "Add new video: beach-sunset.mp4" or "Add new video thumbnail: beach-sunset-thumbnail.jpg".

### Step 3: Add the Video to the Website

1. In the GitHub repository, find and click on the "index.html" file.
2. Click the pencil icon to edit the file.

        />
        <div class="play-icon">‚ñ∂</div>
